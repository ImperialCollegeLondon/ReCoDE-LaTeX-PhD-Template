## Title Page Explanation

This page explains the structure and purpose of the custom title page used in the PhD thesis template for Imperial College London. Each element is annotated to clarify whether it is **mandatory**, **recommended**, or **purely stylistic**.

### Page numbering (Checklist §4.4)

Section 4.4 of the official checklist emphasizes that **all pages must be numbered in one continuous sequence**, from the title page to the last page of text, in **Arabic numerals starting at 1**. This sequence must include *everything* in the document: maps, diagrams, blank pages, etc.

A lot of students forget to number the very first page, treating it as a separate “cover”. Regardless of your aesthetic preferences, the checklist is quite clear on this point: **the title page is page 1** (yes, even if it ruins your minimalist designer soul).

### Required information on the title page (Checklist §4.5)

Section 4.5 specifies that the title page **must** include:

- The **approved title** of the thesis (as confirmed at examination entry)
- The **candidate’s full name**, as registered at the College
- **Imperial College London** and the **name of the Department**
- The **degree** for which the thesis is submitted (e.g. PhD)

The checklist does not explicitly require that you list your supervisors, but it is good practice to include their names and affiliations. This is optional and ultimately your decision.
