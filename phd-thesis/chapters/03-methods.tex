In many experimental analyses, it is important to quantify the variability present in the measurements. 
In this section, we illustrate how to typeset equations in \LaTeX, using the sample standard deviation as a simple example.


The standard deviation provides a measure of how spread out the data are from the mean. For a sample of $n$ observations, $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, the sample standard deviation $s$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(x_i - \bar{x}\right)^2 }
\label{eq:std_sample}
\end{equation}

where $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean:

\begin{equation}
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
\label{eq:mean_sample}
\end{equation}

Equation~\ref{eq:std_sample} shows that the standard deviation increases as the data points deviate more from the mean.
